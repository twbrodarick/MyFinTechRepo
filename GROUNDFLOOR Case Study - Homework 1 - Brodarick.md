# GROUNDFLOOR - Real Estate Specialization Drives Steady, Solid Growth in Competitive FinTech Domains
##Overview and Origin
*Groundfloor Finance, Inc. (d/b/a as GROUNDFLOOR)
*GROUNDFLOOR was organized in 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia and remains headquartered there.
*Co-founded by Brian Dally and Nick Bhargava. Mr. Dally serves as CEO and Mr. Bhargava is the Executive Vice President for Regulatory Affairs. They also hold seats on the company's Board of Directors.
*The company founders first connected in an innovation hub in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina prior to founding the company. Mr. Dally has extensive experience in management consulting and wireless/telephony and mobility. Mr. Bhargava's background is rooted in financial services with significant expertise in securities law.
*Initially capitalized through a combination of angel investors and institutional venture capital (55%) as well as founders' personal capital (45%), the company has shifted its mix to non-affiliated (public) retail investors through three (soon-to-be four) common equity offerings. The company's most recent offering should lower the venture/angel weighting in the capital structure to ~40% and increase retail/public ownership above 15%.
##Business Activities
*The company's business model serves two distinct customer bases. Its lending platform provides competitive, alternate financing for smaller real estate developers and contractors who, due to their scale or less extensive operating history, struggle to secure financing with traditional lenders. By opening loan funding to retail investors, GROUNDFLOOR offers short-term fixed income investment opportunities that exceed yields available through most government debt instruments and bank products like certificates of deposit and savings accounts.
*Though there are approximately 95 million single-family homes in the United States, a historic undersupply of homes currently exists. Since the Great Financial Crisis(GFC) of 2007-2009, homebuilders dramatically reduced new construction for a decade. The commonly cited reason has been an aging population looking to downsize, coupled with a reticence of younger customers to purchase homes and stop renting. As a result, the monthly supply of homes (which measures how long it would take to sell all existing housing inventory absent new construction) dropped from a year in 2009 to an average of five months in the mid-2010s. Dislocation in the job market and lifestyle preferences have also been referenced to justify the smaller pace of home building. However, after twelve years of declining homeownership, the number of Americans who own a home has climbed since 2017, amidst steady population growth, contributing to a a 58% aggregate increase in home prices since 2012.
*GROUNDFLOOR's strategy was developed to provide an alternative source of funding for smaller, less-established developers and contractors to better compete in the improving residential real estate industry without having to rely on bank and mortgage company support.
*The company replicates all of the processes undertaken by these traditional lenders with the exception of shifting funding to individual investors. GROUNDFLOOR assesses the property and market conditions, evaluates the credit worthiness and viability of the borrower's repayment strategy and finally assigns a grade from A-to-G with corresponding interest rates currently ranging from 5.5%-26% depending on the loan's determined riskiness. The loan is then loaded on the company's web platform for retail investors to contribute capital to fund it. Once the loan is fully funded, GROUNDFLOOR services the loan on behalf of investors. The company makes money by charging an initial origination fee and servicing fees throughout the life of the loan. 
*GROUNDFLOOR's user-friendly web platform allows both accredited (high net worth) and non-accredited retail investors to make short-term fixed income investments collateralized by the underlying real estate itself. Investors make incremental investments on individual properties. Unlike REITs and other fixed income funds, investors are provided very granular details on the loans and underlying properties.  For example, investors know the GROUNDFLOOR grade, corresponding interest rate, whether the project is new construction or renovation among other pertinent market data for each potential loan investment.
*Yields are competitive with higher risk junk corporate bonds that typically rely on the borrowing corporation's ability to generate funds to meet its debt obligations are not collateralized by tangible assets as GROUNDFLOOR real estate loans are. 
*Government debt does not necessarily represent a more attractive alternative to GROUNDFLOOR loans currently, given the recent spike in capital markets volatility and the sharp increase in prices across the Treasury yield curve.
*The key techologies GROUNDFLOOR utilizes to manage its web-based platform include:  jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular JS, Heroku, Ruby and Rails among several others.
##Industry Landscape
*GROUNDFLOOR operates at the intersection of alternative finance, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and fixed income crowdfunding.
*These FinTech domains have grown markedly since the GFC subsided. Industry leaders include LendingClub Corp. (unsecured personal loans), OnDeck Capital (small business loans) and Social Finance or SoFi (student loans). These companies were all founded around the same time as GROUNDFLOOR. Their annual revenues reached $758 million for LendingClub, $696 million for SoFi and $445 million for OnDeck in 2019.
*The short history of the industry and its near-singular focus on generating robust revenue growth make traditional profitability metrics less useful in evaluating these companies' performance. On a non-adjusted basis, the industry is not yet profitable given the high rate of reinvestment of revenues back into operations. Valuation instead stands out as an important measure of company success. 
*Most of the industry is still privately-owned and does not disclose financial results. However, LendingClub and OnDeck are notable exceptions as publicly-traded, pure FinTech companies. Their stocks have plummeted 91%-92% over the past five years.
*Even though GROUNDFLOOR revenues reached only $6 million in 2019, the company compares favorably based on its valuation trajectory. A fourth common equity offering to the public is scheduled to close on March 31 and is expected to be fully subscribed. The first equity offering available for all retail investors to participate in was priced at $10/share in July 2018. The current offering prices each GROUNDFLOOR share at $17.50, representing a 75% per share increase in under two years. The ongoing capital raise values GROUNDFLOOR at ~$70 million compared to ~$50 million a year ago.
##Recommendations
*I view GROUNDFLOOR's strategy to develop depth in alternative residential real estate lending and investing as the reason for its steady growth in value and a key differentiator compared to the generalist approach undertaken by LendingClub and OnDeck, for example.
*While the most logical product extension, outside of the recently launched QCMaxx line-of-credit service, might entail augmenting the platform for commercial lending, I think the large dollar amount needed to fund these credits would not work with GROUNDFLOOR's retail investor base; too many investors would be needed to fund them, delaying the loan closing too long to make it attractive for these borrowers.
*In addition to its sales and marketing success in attracting borrowers to the GROUNDFLOOR platform, its rapid expansion across differnt states and lending regulatory regimes shows the company excels at navigating these cumbersome approval processes. 
*At inception, the company only offered loans in Georgia to Georgia-based investors. Now the company serves borrowers and investors in 27 states. Since it has not been approved to operate in either California or New York yet, the company should primarily focus on opening up the two largest state markets not yet available to it. 
*GROUNDFLOOR has leveraged its focus on specialization in one product segment to produce solid growth and continually attract a higher price in its equity raises. The technology it uses seems less of a differentiator than simply enabling its web platform to support its business plan and marketing strategy. 
*The company has stated it plans to execute a liquidation event, most likely in the medium term. However, the smaller revenue base on an absolute basis will make an IPO essentially impossible. Therefore, selling to a larger financial services firm actively looking to augment its FinTech capabilities and plug a platform like GROUNDFLOOR's into its much larger scale, makes more sense.
*An eventual sale to a large cap or mega cap financial services company like Goldman Sachs or JPMorganChase make expanding the customer breadth across more states more imperative than attempting to tack on new products and experiences.
